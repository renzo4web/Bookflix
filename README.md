### Feautures

 - Update Current status of the book to "reading" "to be read" "completed"
 - Search books on your Bookflix
 - Dinamic Navbar (Show name of the user)
 - Connected with Google Books API

#### Why?
I wanted to expand my knowledge of the MERN stack and what better way to put it to work than by creating an app that motivates me to read and at the same time practice programming.
